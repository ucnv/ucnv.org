    <em>E</em> is a series of digital images in which each image has three different version. One of them is an original image. Other two are encoded by the artist's own implemented JPEG and PNG encoders. These two encoders are intentionally made with wrong algorithms.<br>
    This project is to combine two existed projects, <a href="/jpegsinyourbrain"><em>Jpegs in Your Brain</em> (2013)</a> and <a href="/pngencodedbyanincorrectlyimplementedmethod"><em>PNG encoded by an incorrectly implemented method</em> (2016-)</a>.

    It was initially shown as the printed artworks on the artist's solo exhibition "Volatile" at IAMAS library in 2019. Later with over 1,000 image sets, the web version was produced in 2020 and now it can be seen at <a href="https://e.ucnv.org/">https://e.ucnv.org/</a>.
