  <p>UCNV is an artist and programmer based in Tokyo.<br>
  His artist career began with his hobby "glitch". 
  He developed programs to damage image and video files and released the tools as open source. 
  He gradually became a glitch artist, yet the glitching is nothing more than a way to actualize his methodology.<br>
  His work is made with a precise research of the way of digital media. 
  It has done without drawing it to the human recognition or adding the poetic and emotive aspects, differently from general artistic expression. 
  He doesn't see or touch the object to find its essence. 
  He rather destroys it, like shattering a glass to find how hard it is. 
  He does it with his own implemented software and analyzes the subject from the side of digital computation.
